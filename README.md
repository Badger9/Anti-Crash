# Anti-Crash
This could probably be improved, but it generally does the trick.

It'll stop basically all net message based crash exploits, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't fix the pre-existing issues.

Config is located in `lua/autorun/server/badger-anti-crash.lua`, but the default settings should be fine.
